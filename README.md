# Student_Courses_Planner

This is an android apK which idea's is it to help student organise their offline school course resources. We have noticed that, for example 
in ghana, student have their course materials scattered on their phone which is problem becuase they face difficulty in sorting them
out when needed. This is a problem we are  facing in Koforidua Tecnical University. For instance again, the past questions materials 
we take from libraries and from the seniors a level or more ahead of us are always in pdf and images forms. The images are the hardest
to sort becuase you will have to rename each images file to match the course so you can easily locate them and utilize them, instead
of reading the writings in the image to find out what the image contains.
